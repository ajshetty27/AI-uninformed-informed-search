Path Searcher for Rover 

Utilising uninformed and informed search algorithms, a valid shortest path is found for a rover to navigate a terrain. Certain demands such as energy limit for uphill climbing and momentum from previous moves are all accounted for when traversing the graph.

Usage:

Change input.txt to input file of choosing, ensure to specify the search algorithm to be used, along with the energy limit of the rover, number of locations, the locations with their x,y,z coordinates, number of safe paths and safe paths for the rover to navigate in a txt file.

Code generates an output of a feasible shortest path along with a path length.
